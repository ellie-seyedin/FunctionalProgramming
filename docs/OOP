Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects".

 which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties),
 
 and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

 Python is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports object-oriented programming.
 In Python, everything is an object, including classes themselves.

 1. Classes and Objects

 Classes: provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.
Objects are instances of classes. An objectâ€™s properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) are defined by its class.

2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. In Python, encapsulation is not enforced strictly as it is in some other languages, but it can be achieved using private attributes (using underscores, e.g., _private_var).

3. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. The class being inherited from is called the parent or superclass, and the class that inherits is called the child or subclass.

4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows for the use of a single type entity (method, operator, or object) to represent different types in different scenarios.

5. Abstraction
Abstraction means hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. Python achieves this through abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be subclassed. It can contain abstract methods, which are methods declared in the abstract class but must be implemented by the subclass.

* Abstract methods can only exist within abstract base classes.
* A class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared as abstract.
* Child classes of the abstract base class must implement all abstract methods to be instantiable.
* Abstract methods enforce a contract for subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface across implementations.
