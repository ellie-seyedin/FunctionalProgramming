------ LAMBDA EXPRESSION --------

lambda takes a number of parameters and an expression combining these parameters, and creates an anonymous function that returns
the value of the expression.

Lambda functions are convenient for functional programming, especially when you need to pass a simple function as an argument to a higher-order function

An alternative is to just use the def statement and define a function in the usual way
Which alternative is preferable? usual way?
One reason for writer's preference is that lambda is quite limited in the functions it can define.
The result has to be computable as a single expression, which means you canâ€™t have multiway if... elif... else comparisons or try... except statements
