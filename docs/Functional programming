Functional programming decomposes a problem into a set of functions. 
Ideally, functions only take inputs and produce outputs, and don’t have any internal state that affects the output 
produced for a given input. Well-known functional languages include the ML family (Standard ML, OCaml, and other variants) and Haskell.

. Python are multi-paradigm; you can write programs or libraries that are largely
1: procedural
2: object-oriented
3: functional 


(In a large program, different sections might be written using different approaches; the GUI might be object-oriented while the processing logic is procedural or functional, for example.)

* In a functional program, input flows through a set of functions.  Each function operates on its input and produces some output
Functional style discourages functions with side effects that modify internal state or make other changes that aren’t visible in the function’s return value. Functions that have no side effects at all are called purely functional.

 ? Avoiding side effects means not using data structures that get updated as a program runs; every function’s output must only depend on its input


 Functional programming can be considered the opposite of object-oriented programming. Objects are little capsules containing some internal state along with a collection of method calls that let you modify this state, and programs consist of making the right set of state changes. Functional programming wants to avoid state changes as much as possible and works with data flowing between functions. In Python you might combine the two approaches by writing functions that take and return instances representing objects in your application (e-mail messages, transactions, etc.).

* Advantages to the functional style:
1-Formal provability: it’s easier to construct a mathematical proof that a functional program is correct

2-Modularity:  break apart your problem into small pieces. It’s easier to specify and write a small function that does one thing than a large function that performs a complicated transformation. Small functions are also easier to read and to check for errors.

3-Composability: You’ll assemble new programs by arranging existing functions in a new configuration and writing a few functions specialized for the current task.

4-Ease of debugging and testing: Testing is easier because each function is a potential subject for a unit test. Functions don’t depend on system state that needs to be replicated before running a test
